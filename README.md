## 🎯 Objective
The goal is to display my badge on my personal **GitHub profile README** !

## 🛠️ How I'm Building It
- I'm building my badge **from scratch**, using **AI** as a tool to support my **learning** and strengthen my **software development skills** without losing control over it
- First, I'm designing it using **HTML/CSS**, then I'll write a Python **screenshot script** using **AI assistance**
